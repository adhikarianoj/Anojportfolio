									<p>
									Beyond the numbers, I'm proficient in tools like Tableau, PowerBI ensuring that the insights I uncover aren't confined to spreadsheets but come to life through interactive and visually compelling dashboards. This commitment to clear communication ensures that everyone, from data scientists to executives, can grasp the significance of the findings.
